<h1>Ogre for Python</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This document describes the Python interface to Ogre. 
The Python interface to Ogre is a Python package that 
enables Python programs to communicate with OSE programs 
running on a Cello node.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
Here is a Python script that
hunts a remote process running on CPP target node, sends a request
signal and receives a reply signal:</p>

<p>
<div class="example">
<pre>
# Load Ogre for Python
import ogre

# Load signal definitions
from test_signals import *

# Connect to the Cello node
gw = ogre.create('tcp://172.17.226.207:22001', 'demo')

# Hunt for the remote process 
gw.hunt('target/000600/test_proc')
pid = gw.receive().sender()
print 'Found process: %d' % (pid)

# Allocate signal, assign values to signal attributes and finally send it
requestsig = TestReq()
requestsig.a = 1
requestsig.b = 2
requestsig.c = 3

print 'Sending signal:' + requestsig
gw.send(requestsig, pid)

# Wait for a reply and print the received signal
replysig = gw.receive()
print 'Received signal:', replysig
print 'Finished.'
</pre>
</div>   
</p>

<h3>API Reference</h3>

<p>
Documentation generated from pyogre source code is here:
<a href="api/ogre.html" target="_blank">package ogre</a>.
The API contains following classes:

<ul>
<li><a href="api/ogre.osegw.html#Osegw">Osegw</a> - OSE Gateway communication protocol
<li><a href="api/ogre.linx.html#Linx">Linx</a> - Linx communication protocol
<li><a href="api/ogre.process.html#Process">Process</a> - Target process
<li><a href="api/ogre.signal.html#Signal">Signal</a> - Signal definition
</ul>
</p>

<p>
And a helper module:

<ul>
<li><a href="api/ogre.constraints.html" target="api">constraints</a>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You can also use <code>pydoc</code> command line utility to query 
online documentation.</p>


<h3>Defining OSE Signals in Python</h3>

<p>
Before being able to send and receive OSE signals the signal structure
definition must be converted to Python. Lets assume following signal
in C language:
</p>

<p>
<div class="example">
<pre>
#define TEST_REQ (1234) /*!- SIGNO(TestReq) -!*/

typedef struct
{
  SIGSELECT sigNo;
  U16 a;
  U32 b;
  U8 c;
} TestReq;
</pre>
</div>
</p>

<p>
OSE signal is a block of memory - an array of bytes. First 4 bytes always
constitute the signal number (<code>sigNo</code> in the example) which is
used to identify the type of the signal.
In C the data is accessed through C union or by typecasting it directly
to the C structure. 
In Python signals are defined as classes and signal data is represented 
as objects attributes. 
</p>

<p>
In C the user defines new signal by defining the data structure.
In Python user defines a new class that inheriths from 
<code>ogre.Signal</code> base class and overrides at least two methods: 
<code>serialize()</code> and <code>unserialize()</code>.
</p>

The responsibility of <code>serialize()</code> is to know how the
attributes of the signal are converted into array of bytes.
The responsibility of <code>unserialize()</code> is to know how to
convert array of bytes into attributes.
</p>

<p>
When <code>_toStringBuffer()</code> method is called (defined in 
<code>ogre.Signal</code> base class) the base class will call 
<code>serialize()</code> which return an array of bytes.
Base class will allocate new OSE signal buffer and copy the array of
bytes as the data in the new signal.
</p>

<p>
When user calls <code>receive()</code> function the system will
get the next signal from signal queue and look for the first 4 bytes
of the signal data: the signal number.
It then instantiates the signal class and calls 
<code>unserialize()</code> on it, providing the rest of the signal
data to the method as an array of bytes.
</p>

<p>
To be able to unserialize received signal data, the system must know which 
signal class to instantiate.
Therefore user must register the signal classes into the system to
establish signal number -> signal class mapping.
When OSE signal is received the <code>receive()</code> function will
find out the signal number by looking for the first 4 bytes of signal
data and then see if the user has registered a signal class with 
matching signal number. Assuming the class is found it is instantiated
and <code>unserialize()</code> is called. If class does not
exist, then system instantiates a default
class which does not contain <code>unserialize()</code> method at all.
</p>

<p>
These conversions will happen automatically.
Serialization methods in signal classes are the only place where user
sees a hint what happens behind the scenes.
The signal class definition of TestReq looks like in the example below.
</p>

<p>
<div class="example">
<pre>
class TestReq(ogre.Signal):

    SIGNO = 1234

    def __init__(self):
        ogre.Signal.__init__(self, self.SIGNO)
        self.a = None
        self.b = None
        self.c = None

    def serialize(self, abi):
        abi.writeU16(self.a)
        abi.writeU32(self.b)
        abi.writeU8(self.c)

    def unserialize(self, abi):
        self.a = abi.readU16()
        self.b = abi.readU32()
        self.c = abi.readU8()
</pre>
</div>
<p>

<div class="note">
<b>Note</b> that since C compiler does word alignment by default
the <code>abi</code> objects also do this:
if for example 32 bit word is written at address which is not 32 bit aligned,
pad bytes will be added automatically until the next 32 bit aligned address
is reached.
</div>
<p>

Converting <code>.sig</code> files into Python is usually quite
straightforward. There is a tool called <code>pysigge</code> included
which parses signal files and generates Python
code automatically.<p>


<h3>Logging</h3>

Python Ogre supports automatic tracing of basic events like sending and
receiving signals. It also traces the attribute values automatically.
<p>

The tracing is implemented with a <i>logging</i> package which is part of
Python standard library. Logging is similar to CPP Trace & Error 
system, but instead of trace groups it uses severity levels that are: 
DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL. 
User can select which levels are logged. For example if INFO
is selected, then levels INFO, WARN, ERROR and CRITICAL are logged
and DEBUG is discarded.<p>

Logs can be forwarded to screen, written to file or even sent to 
remote system for further processing.<p>

You can use <a href="logging.ini">logging.ini</a> to get CPP-like 
formatting for the log messages. As an example of logs generated by the
system, see the following logs:

<ul>
<li><a href="test.log">test.log</a>
</ul>

<h3>Process</h3>

The package includes a helper class
<a href="api/ogre.process.html#Process">Process</a>, which takes care of
the hunt and attach handling.

Here is an example how to send a OSE signal directly from 
the Python shell using
the Process class

<div class="example">

&gt;&gt;&gt; p.send(sig)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print = p.receive()
&lt;OSESIG SyncReq(sigNo=12001): { t4=0 sigNo=12001 t2=0 t3=0 t1=10 sender_pid=983586 data= }&gt;
</pre>
