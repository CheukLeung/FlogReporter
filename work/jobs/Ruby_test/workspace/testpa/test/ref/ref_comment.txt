# 
# [RequirementSpecification]
# BBW.ABS.func_1 E<>(5*(v-w*R)>v and brake==0)
# 
# [Purpose]
# Slip rate
# 
# [Description]
# Verify if the slip rate is larger than 0.2, the brake torque should be equal to zero
# 
# [Type]
# Functionality
# 
# [Level]
# Structural component
# 
# [ActionEvent]
# A1 Send in a signal such that v is larger than 0 and slip rate is larger than 0.2.
# E1 The module should goes into CalSlipRate state.
# E2 The brake torque should be set to zero.
# E3 The module should goes into Exit state.
# E4 A signal is sent from the module to the test scripts.
# 
# [PassCriteria]
# PASS if parameter values in the return signal are the same as the expected values.
# 
# [EnvironmentRequirement]
# Perform the test using signal communication on Linux.
